# Cognition and Mental Health Lab website

Welcome to the Cognition and Mental Health Lab website!

Here is the code that builds pages that correspond to the team members, our publications, our news, and our vacancies. 

Most of the page structure is in the 'pages' folder, with '_posts' being news items/blog posts. These are in markdown format - the easiest way to make a new one is copy an old one, and update the 'frontmatter' between the --- marks at the top to refer to the link you want (and edit the navigation file/other links as necessary!). 

To update the team pages, edit the team.yml file in _data/. Similarly, there's a navigation.yml file in there that can be edited to change how the menu bars (etc) work.
