Within the Cognition and Mental Health lab, we are working on a variety of different topics. These include <button onclick="window.location.href='/projects/iu/';">(intolerance of) uncertainty</button> and <button onclick="window.location.href='/projects/interoception/';">interoception</button>.


<h2> Sensations from our stomach</h2>
    <p><a href="https://cognition-mental-health.github.io/people/#Lucy+Stafford">Lucy</a> is recruiting <a href="https://york.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cGQuWRwC1lKqcHs">participants who identify as having an eating disorder</a> to complete an online survey to refine a new scale assessing how we feel about sensations from our stomach. She is looking for other participants to refine the questionnaire too - including <a href="https://york.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0vwfUyvV5r2tGWq">those with a gastric disorder</a>, or <a href="https://york.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_brelvivpJ8PO5gi">neither a gastric or eating disorder</a>.</p> 
<h2> Life events, everyday concerns and disordered eating</h2>
    <p><a href="https://cognition-mental-health.github.io/people/#Holly+Myers">Holly</a> is recruiting participants for her online study on life events, everyday concerns and disordered eating.
